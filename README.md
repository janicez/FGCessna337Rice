... oh my god it's a turbo cessna!

So some random idiot got bored one evening and decided she'd do well to write an FDM for the Cessna T337. Well she got carried away
and made one for that with a careful owner who doesn't use too much boost and for a not so careful owner who put a 22psi turbo
on the thing and increased the gearing.

The T337 and riced simulations have engine pressure gauges modified from the default to display engine pressure in psi rather than inHg.
